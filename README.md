Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11


Select your Operating System (OS)

Downloading and Installing Windows 11

I selected Windows 11 as my Operating System of Choice as follows:

Step1:
Download Windows 11 using the link below: Download Windows 11  as this was deemed the best option out of 3 options for downloading the OS.

Step 2:
Once downloading was completed, I clicked on the “open file” prompt at the downloads, top right corner of my screen and proceeded to perform a PC health check for my device as prompted, which process the led me to begin the installation by first accepting the terms in the License Agreement, then by pressing the “Install” button and following the installation process as prompted. 

Step 3:
Once the Installation was completed, I then restarted my computer whence my computer upgraded to Windows 11 upon restarting it. 

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

Install a Text Editor or Integrated Developer Environment (IDE)

I selected and installed a text editor or IDE suitable for my programming languages and workflow by downloading and Installing Visual Studio Code (VS Code) via the link  https://code.visualstudio.com/Download and following the process below:
The link took me to the official VS Code website wherein I selected the current version, Version 1.74 and I clicked on the “Download” button to download it for Windows. Once the download was completed, I double-clicked on it to install by first accepting the agreement for this open source version of VS Code owned by Microsoft. The program was installed on my PC and saved in my Apps on my Desktop. I decided not to change its location for ease of access. The App launched automatically when I clicked on the “Finish” button in the installation process.
I did not encounter any problems installing VS Code and I was able to use it by linking it to my Github and using VS code for writing code and completing my student assignments for this SE course.


3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com


Set Up for Version Control System (Git & Github)

Git is an open source distributed version control system (VCS) designed to handle small and large projects. To install and configure Git and create my Github account for hosting my repositories, the following process was followed: 


Step 1: I searched for Git on the browser and clicked on one of the links on search results, which search led me to their official website https://github.com/ 

Step 2: After clicking and landing on their welcome page, I selected and clicked on the latest version for “download for Windows” with standalone installer and waited as it proceeded with downloading the file.

Step 3: Once successfully downloaded the exe file, I double clicked on it for installing file to begin and proceeded with the setup, whilst the installing process was ongoing, clicking “next” for file to be installed in ‘Program Files’ on the C: drive of my PC. 

Step 4: I clicked on “Next” on the start menu folder and proceeded to choose default editor once prompted. 

Step 5: Clicked on “Next” again to use bundled open secure shell (SSH)

Step 6: Click on next again for windows style commit unix and select “keep the same” before clicking on “Next” 

Step 7: Keep the default file by selecting “keep the same”, again and for the next few steps, keep select “keep the same” and click next. 

Step 8: Clicked on “Install” and without checking (ticking) any of the boxes, to “finish” the installation process. 

Step 9: Once done, I went to the start button and typed “cmd” and clicked on “open” to open the command prompt, wherein I typed git and pressed enter whence I got the “Get Started” prompt and the confirmation screen showed Git was successfully installed on my PC. 


4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.


Installation of Programming Language - Python

To install the programming language, Python, for my projects and their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes, the steps I followed are as below:

Steps:

Downloaded Python from the official Python website, http://wwww.python.org/ 
Once download complete, I installed the package by running the installer and following the instructions, ensuring that I checked (tick) the option to add Python to my PATH. 

Challenges experienced. 
Each time, I tried to download the version 3.8.6 as per the instruction on the course manual, I was re-directed to a live link the current version Python 3.12.4 available for downloading. After several attempts at downloading the older version, published in 2022, I decided to download the latest version as per this directive. 

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

Challenges experienced :
Initially, I didn’t set up the environment correctly as my package did not have MySQL Workbench which made it unable to complete the simple code practice upon completing the installation process, there was no output from my code. I re-configured by making sure I check all the boxes this time around and my output was a success. 

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
